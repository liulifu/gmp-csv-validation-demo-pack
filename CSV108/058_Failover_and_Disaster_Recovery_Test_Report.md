# Failover and Disaster Recovery Test Report

## 1. Objective

Verify technical failover, disaster recovery, approved recovery objectives and manual continuity reconciliation.

## 2. Results

| Test | Scenario | Actual result | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| DRT-001 | Application-node failover | No committed transaction lost; user reconnect supported | Pass; 3-minute service interruption |
| DRT-002 | Regional DR activation | Production-equivalent service restored | Pass; service available in 5 h 46 min |
| DRT-003 | RPO/RTO/reconciliation | RPO ≤15 min; RTO ≤8 h | RPO 7 min; RTO 6 h 35 min incl. validation; Pass |
| DRT-004 | Manual continuity/reconciliation | All pre-numbered forms reconciled once | 32 simulated forms reconciled; no duplicate/missing record |

## 3. Application-level checks

After DR activation, users authenticated, selected signed records and audit trails were retrievable, queued interface messages reconciled, backups restarted and monitoring alerts cleared.

## 4. Conclusion

The design met RPO/RTO and continuity acceptance criteria. Annual exercises remain mandatory.

DR acceptance requires confirmation that the recovered service is usable for regulated work, not only technically online. Before exit, business and QA reviewers shall confirm sample retrieval, audit trail retrieval, signature visibility, interface reconciliation, backup restart, monitoring status and disposition of any manual continuity records.

| DR exit check | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| RTO/RPO | Recovery timing and selected recovery point documented |
| Application usability | User login and representative record retrieval successful |
| Data integrity | Audit/signature and selected record checks pass |
| Interface consistency | Queues and acknowledgements reconciled |
| Continuity reconciliation | Manual forms/backlog accounted for before normal processing resumes |
