## 1. Objective

Confirm that the production design supports expected users, interface throughput, reports and five-year data growth.

## 2. Results

| Test | Load/scenario | Acceptance | Actual/outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLC-001 | 200 concurrent mixed users | 95th percentile ≤3.0 s for standard transactions | 2.4 s after cache/index correction; Pass |
| PLC-002 | 10,000 interface messages/hour | No loss; backlog clears within 30 min | 10,000 accepted/rejected as designed; backlog 12 min; Pass |
| PLC-003 | 100,000-result report | Generate ≤5 min without truncation | 3 min 42 sec; Pass |
| PLC-004 | Five-year capacity forecast | ≥30% headroom and alerts at 70/85% | Projected peak 61%; alert tests passed |

## 3. Deviation DEV-004

The initial stability dashboard response was 3.8 seconds at peak load. A database index and cache setting reduced the 95th percentile to 2.4 seconds. No data correctness or integrity issue occurred.

## 4. Conclusion

Performance and capacity meet the approved release criteria.
